- ðŸ‘‹    Hi, Iâ€™m TimothÃ©e Soyeux, a french new(bie?) web developer,
        who made a career change when Covid struck the world.
        
- ðŸ‘€    Iâ€™m interested in learning all the stuff a modern web developer needs to learn to be efficient and up to date.
        I'm currently working for a french telecommunication-oriented company. My mission is to build a custom-made CRM,
        by gathering datas from 2 actual applications in a single one.
        My actual stack :
        
        PHP Vanilla
        HTML/CSS
        SQL
        Javascript with Jquery

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning BEM methodology and SASS/SCSS on my spare time to become more organized with my front-end workflow.
      I'm also learning Symfony for my master's degree @ENI, the french school I'm a student at (apprenticeship).
      My goal for 2022 is to learn a modern Javascript Framework and to build an application with it.
